Differences in security between the last and the current governments in Mexico 
========================================================

Last Presidential term (2006-2012) in Mexico was characterized for the violence generated by the war against drug cartels. The current president belongs to a different party and he claimed that his security strategy would be more effective.

In this work, I will try to analize different security indicators for different Presidential terms: 2000-2006, 2006-2012 and 2012-present to see if there are clear differences in security betweeen goverments. 

The webpage <a href="http://crimenmexico.diegovalle.net/en/">http://crimenmexico.diegovalle.net/en/</a> has some illustrative plots of a subset of crimes-related variables from the site <a href = "http://www.secretariadoejecutivo.gob.mx/es/SecretariadoEjecutivo/Incidencia_Delictiva">Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad PÃºblica </a>. To be clear, what I plan to do is to use the same source to read all the variables and then generate plots to compare the different Presidential terms.

The data has some irregularities, such as events not recorded for some periods of time, but I will try to do the best I can. It might be a good idea to use `shiny` to create a more complete work.
