Differences in security between the last and the current goverments in Mexico 
========================================================

Last Presidential term (2006-2012) in Mexico was characterized for the war against drug cartels. The current president claims belongs to a different party and he claimed that his security strategy would be more effective. 

In this work, I will try to analize different security indicators for different Presidential terms: 2000-2006, 2006-2012 and 2012-present to see if there are clear differences in security betweeen goverments.
